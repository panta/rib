# Rib

Rib is a foundation library for building [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script) applications.

Rib consists of a collection of production-quality essential and highly useful classes, mixins and functions.

Rib is thoroughly tested using [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/)

Rib works both on the client (browser) and on the server (node.js).

Rib is extremely lightweight (1.3K minified and compressed).
